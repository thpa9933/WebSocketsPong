# socketPong!

Play ping pong with your mobile device!

Follow the steps to play:

1. Make sure everyone is on the same wifi (unless you push this to a server, then local host will be that servers ip)
2. On your PC, go to localhost:3000/index.html (this is your gameboard!)
3. For player 1, on your mobile device go to _your network ip_:3000/p1.html
4. For player 2, on your mobile device go to _your network ip_:3000/p2.html
5. Slide your thumb horizontally, or just turn your phone. Keep your thumb down!

_your network ip_ can be found (on a mac) in system preferences > network
To reset high score, change highscore.txt to 0.
